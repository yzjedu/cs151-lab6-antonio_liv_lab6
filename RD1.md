# Reflection Document

* Drive Full Name  : Liv Oakes
* Partner Full Name: Antonio Dueno Martinez
* Student ID: 1902495

* **Objective**:
  * What were you supposed to learn/accomplish? 
    *  How to rewrite codes and make each task a function within the program.
* **Procedure**:
  * What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?
    * First Antonio and I read the README to make sure we understood the entire problem as well as all the requirements.
    * Next we worked on the algorithm together, but Antonio recorded it. 
    * After having our algorithm checked, I was able to turn it into code for the program.
    * We then tested our program to make sure it runs correctly and without any errors.
    * Finally, I completed the flowchart and made sure it included everything.
  * What were the Key concepts explored? 
    * How to correctly rewrite previous code. 

* **Results**: 
  * Did your results match what you expected to get? 
    * Yes, our results matched what we expected to get.
  * Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases? 
    * We used test cases for each possible outcome, but no extreme test cases.
* **Reflection**:
  * What challenges did you encounter? 
    * When doing our algorithm we seemed to keep missing a few things but after reevaluating it we were able to fix our mistakes and continue with the lab.
  * How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?
    * I followed the first 3 rules of programming by designing the program first with an algorithm, and then turning it into code, and finally testing it to make sure it runs correctly and then fixing any errors that came about.
  * Any key takeaways? 
    * The class lecture notes were very helpful when we got stuck on something.
  * Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab? 
    * I definitely think I learned what I was supposed to for this lab and I really enjoyed doing it too. 
  * What was it like working with your partner?
    * I think Antonio and I worked great together. I enjoyed working with him alot, and we were both able to help each other with different things. We also split up the work evenly, I did the code and the flowchart and Antonio wrote the algorithm and the testcases and revised the code to make it better.
