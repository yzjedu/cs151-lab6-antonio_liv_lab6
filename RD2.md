### Objective
#### What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?
In this lab we were meant to rewrite the code for lab 5 and make it include functions.

### Procedure
#### What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?
1. First we created an algorithm so we could visualize how we wanted to rewrite the code for the ATM simulator.
2. We used the pre-existing test cases to see what the expected results of the program were.
3. We wrote the new code for the program, and debugged it until the program functioned as intended. 

#### What were the key concepts explored?
In this lab, we explored the usage of functions in a program, and learned how to define and call functions.

#### Did your results match what you expected to get?
The results of the program were identical to the results of the lab 5 code, so yes.

#### Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases?
We utilized the pre-existing test cases.

### Reflection
#### What challenge did you encounter?
Making sure that the functions were being called correctly was difficult.

#### How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?
We created the algorithm before we began writing the code, we made sure the program was readable by a human by 
including comments and clear variables, and we practiced before coding with our experience with the prompt in lab 5.

#### Did you overcome them and how?
We overcame the challenges via trial and error. Eventually we were able to figure out that the functions weren't being called
correctly due to an issue with how we wrote out the code.

#### Any Key takeaways?
Definitely seek more practice with functions for future labs or PAs.

#### Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?
I think I gained valuable experience working with functions in this lab.

#### What was it like working with your partner?
Working with Liz went well. She was very helpful when writing the algorithm and code, and was very receptive when discussing the lab.
